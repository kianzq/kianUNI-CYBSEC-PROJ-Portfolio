# MalCommandGuard – Malicious Command Detection System

# Overview
MalCommandGuard is a security-focused command detection system designed to identify potentially malicious or suspicious command-line activity. The project explores a hybrid detection approach combining rule-based analysis, machine learning, and NLP techniques to assess command behavior and assign risk levels.

# Key Focus Areas
- Detection of malicious command patterns and LOLBins abuse
- Obfuscation identification (e.g., Base64, encoded commands)
- Risk scoring and explainable detection outputs
- Secure logging and audit-friendly design

# Technologies
Python, Scikit-learn, ML and NLP techniques, Regex, Secure Logging
