# Breach and Attack Simulation, Detection and Analysis (BASDA)

## Overview
This project simulates realistic cyber attack scenarios (specifically Phishing Attack during Covid-19 Pandemic) to study attacker behavior, detection mechanisms, and response effectiveness. It focuses on analyzing the attack lifecycle and evaluating defensive controls in a controlled environment.

## Key Focus Areas
- Attack simulation and adversarial techniques
- Detection of indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Incident analysis and response evaluation
- Security control assessment and hardening

## Technologies
Attack Simulation Tools (HiddenEye, KeyLogger integration, Phishing Server, Ngrok, and Socail Engineering (Victims Attempts)), Log Analysis (PhishTool, WHOIS Lookup, SPF Checks, Wireshark (Traffic Packets), HTTP Requests), Threat Modeling Concepts
