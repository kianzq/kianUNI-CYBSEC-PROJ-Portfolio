## ✅Conclusion
Through this project, I gained practical insight into how phishing attacks exploit both human behavior and technical weaknesses to bypass security controls and exfiltrate sensitive data. By designing and executing a controlled phishing simulation, I developed a deeper understanding of end-to-end attack workflows, from initial social engineering to credential harvesting, payload execution, and data exfiltration.

I also strengthened my digital forensics and network traffic analysis skills by identifying malicious indicators within captured traffic, such as abnormal DNS queries, suspicious TCP communication patterns, and behavioral signatures associated with keylogging activity. This reinforced the importance of distinguishing malicious traffic from legitimate network behavior and preserving forensic integrity during incident analysis.

Additionally, the project enhanced my awareness of real-world operational challenges, including secure lab setup, tunneling service configuration, and accurate threat interpretation in monitoring tools. Most importantly, I learned the value of defense-in-depth strategies, combining technical controls, user awareness, and policy-driven security aligned with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Overall, this project strengthened my incident analysis mindset and emphasized the critical role of proactive detection, response planning, and ethical responsibility in modern cybersecurity operations.
